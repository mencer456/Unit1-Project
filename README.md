# Unit1-Project
Project for Digital Narrative and Interactive Spring 2021. Took the script of 'Rocky Horror Picture' and created a network from the characters./n 
Each character is placed either into the open-minded or close-minded group; I decided their placement off of how I percieved them in the film. Assigned each character with attribute (innocence, unconventionalism, and offendability) values between 1-3. These values were also decided by me. Parsed the text of the script to assign each character all of thier lines in the script. Created a model based off the Schelling Segregation Model and code we went over in class. If two characters were in the same neighborhood, and their attributes did not mesh, one of the characters has a chance of murdering the other character. Created a network graph based of the finalized netowrk model, and produced a short dialogue from the character's lines.
